Temperature- and pressure-dependent rate coefficients for the HACA pathways from benzene to naphthalene
Alexander M. Mebel, Yuri Georgievskii, Ahren W. Jasper, Stephen J. Klippenstein
Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 36 (2017) 919â€“926

New species W4, W5, P2 were added by Te-Chun Chu at the same G3(MP2,CC)//B3LYP/6-311G** level of theory. TST rates are all calculated in Arkane by using molecular information from the literature.
